# Getting started

# Exercise vs working mapping template

# Mapping steps

# Different types of mapping

# Push changes to GitHub

You would eventually like to _save_ your mapping not only locally on your computer, but remotely on GitHub too. You have then to _commit_ your work and eventually  _push_ it to GitHub. Doing so, you will sync the GitHub repository with the most updated mapping version on your local machine.

You can do it within RStudio: [hands-on session within RStudio](https://inbo-tutorials.netlify.com/git/rstudio/#/). You can alternatively use GitHub Desktop: [hands-on session with GitHub Desktop](https://inbo-tutorials.netlify.com/git/desktop/#/).
