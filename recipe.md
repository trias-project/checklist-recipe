# Getting started

# Exercise vs working mapping template

# Mapping steps

# Different types of mapping

# Push changes to GitHub

You would eventually like to _save_ your mapping not only locally on your computer, but remotely on GitHub too. You have then to _commit_ your work and eventually  _push_ it to GitHub. Doing so, you will sync the GitHub repository with the most updated mapping version on your local machine.

You can do it within RStudio: [hands-on session within RStudio](https://inbo-tutorials.netlify.com/git/rstudio/#/). You can alternatively use GitHub Desktop: [hands-on session with GitHub Desktop](https://inbo-tutorials.netlify.com/git/desktop/#/).

# Using IPT to publish

# Examples

Based on this recipe we were able to publish several checklists on GBIF:

1. [Checklist of non-native freshwater fishes in Flanders](https://trias-project.github.io/alien-fishes-checklist/)
2. [Inventory of alien macroinvertebrates in Flanders, Belgium](https://github.com/trias-project/alien-macroinvertebrates)
3. [Catalogue of the Rust Fungi of Belgium](https://github.com/trias-project/uredinales-belgium-checklist)
